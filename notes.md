## Technology Stack

### Definition:
- **Technology Stack:** Collection of technologies used to create or deliver a web application.
- Usually layered on top of each other.

### Components:
- **Web Framework:** React
- **Web Server:** Caddy (Hosted on AWS)
- **Web Services:** Node.js
- **Database:** MongoDB (Hosted on MongoDB Atlas)

### Considerations:
- No one-size-fits-all solution.
- Stack evolves over time.
- Typically use what the company has invested in.
- Migrating to new stack is costly and error-prone.
- Maximize effectiveness regardless of technology.
- Discontent over tech choices can disrupt team.
- Validate changes for monetary, performance, or security gains.

### Complex Stack Example:
- Small web application company's stack.
- Incorporates numerous technologies.
- Considerations: Dependability, support, scalability, performance, security, productivity factors.

## Caddy

Caddy is a web service that listens for incoming HTTP requests and serves static files or routes requests to other web services.

### Reasons for Using Caddy:
1. **HTTPS Support:** Handles creation and rotation of web certificates for easy HTTPS support.
2. **Static File Serving:** Serves static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
3. **Gateway for Subdomain Requests:** Routes requests to project services, e.g., Simon and startup application services.

### Configuration Files:
- **Caddyfile:** `~/Caddyfile` - Defines routing of HTTP requests, including serving static files and proxying requests. Typically, only domain configuration needs modification.
- **HTML Files:** `~/public_html` - Directory containing files served by Caddy. Configured in Caddyfile. Links to `/usr/share/caddy` in Caddyfile.

### Example Configuration in Caddyfile:
plaintext
:80 {
      root * /usr/share/caddy
      file_server
}

## HTTPS, TLS, and Web Certificates

Until now, you've been accessing your web server using HTTP, which might have triggered warnings in your browser about insecure connections.

### Background:
- Initially, HTTP was widely used, especially for document servers, due to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness.
- However, with the advent of Web 2.0 and the rise of web applications, secure connections became essential to protect user data.
- HTTPS (Secure Hypertext Transport Protocol) is the secure version of HTTP, employing Transport Layer Security (TLS) for encryption.
- TLS ensures data security by negotiating a shared secret between the server and client to encrypt communication.

### Web Certificates:
- Web certificates, issued by trusted third parties, validate domain ownership and facilitate secure connections.
- Previously, obtaining certificates was expensive and cumbersome, but initiatives like Let's Encrypt now offer free certificates, enhancing web security.
- Let's Encrypt dynamically generates and renews certificates using the ACME protocol, making the web safer for everyone.

### Enabling HTTPS:
- Modern browsers expect secure connections, and HTTP/3 supports only secure connections.
- Web servers can obtain and renew certificates by enabling the ACME protocol and communicating with Let's Encrypt.
- Caddy, our web service gateway, has built-in ACME support, simplifying the process of configuring HTTPS.

### Configuring HTTPS with Caddy:
1. SSH into your production environment server.
2. Edit Caddy's configuration (Caddyfile) in the ubuntu user's home directory.
3. Modify Caddy rules to handle requests for your domain and route traffic for web applications.
4. Save changes and restart Caddy to apply the configuration.
5. Verify HTTPS functionality by accessing your domain in a browser.

### Assignment:
- Secure your web server communication by configuring Caddy to request a certificate from Let's Encrypt for your domain name.
- Submit your web server's hostname URL to the Canvas assignment.
- Update your GitHub startup repository notes.md with the newly learned concepts.

### Common Problems:
| Symptom                                          | Reason                                                                   |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Browser doesn't display website                  | Check for www subdomain prefix; ensure proper Caddy configuration.       |
| Root domain works, but not subdomains            | Typographical errors in Caddy configuration; ensure removal of colons.  |
| Subdomains work, but not root domain             | Typographical errors in Caddy configuration.                            |


## The Console

# CSS Overview

## Introduction to CSS

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) converts the structure and content of HTML into a vibrant, responsive experience. The initial objective of CSS was to simply style the HTML based upon the desires of the user, developer, and browser. In modern web applications CSS styling focuses more on helping the developer create complex renderings of dynamic content that is responsive to the actions of the user and the device the application is rendered on. With CSS a web programmer can animate the page, deploy custom fonts, respond to user actions, and dynamically alter the entire layout of the page based on the size of a device and its orientation.

### Basic Concepts

- CSS converts HTML structure and content into visually appealing and responsive designs.
- Initially aimed at styling HTML content, modern CSS is integral for creating dynamic and responsive web applications.

## CSS Rules and Structure

### Rulesets

Functionally, CSS is primarily concerned with defining rulesets, or simply rules. A rule is comprised of a selector that selects the elements to apply the rule to, and one or more declarations that represent the property to style with the given property value.

### Example Rule

```css
p {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-size: 2em;
  color: navy;
  text-shadow: 3px 3px 1px #cccccc;
}
```

## Associating CSS with HTML

There are three ways that you can associate CSS with HTML. The first way is to use the style attribute of an HTML element and explicitly assign one or more declarations.

```html
<p style="color:green">CSS</p>
```

The next way to associate CSS is to use the HTML style element to define CSS rules within the HTML document. The style element should appear in the head element of the document so that the rules apply to all elements of the document.

```html
<head>
  <style>
    p {
      color: green;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <p>CSS</p>
</body>
```

The final way to associate CSS is to use the HTML link element to create a hyperlink reference to an external file containing CSS rules. The link element must appear in the head element of the document.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
```

## Cascading Styles

Because elements inherit the rules applied to their parents you often end up with the same declaration property applied to a single element multiple times. For example, we might set color property for all body elements to be red, and then paragraph elements to be green, and then span elements to be blue, and finally use a style element on a specific span to be black.

```html
<body>
  <p><span style="color:black">CSS</span></p>
</body>
```

```css
body {
  color: red;
}
p {
  color: green;
}
span {
  color: blue;
}
```

## The Box Model

CSS defines everything as boxes. When you apply styles, you are applying them to a region of the display that is a rectangular box. Within an element's box there are several internal boxes. The innermost box holds the element's content. This is where things like the text or image of an element is displayed. Next comes the padding. The padding will inherit things like the background color. After padding is the border, which has properties like color, thickness and line style. The final box is the margin. The margin is considered external to the actual styling of the box and therefore only represents whitespace. It is important to understand each of these boxes so that you can achieve the desired visual result by applying the proper CSS declaration.

## CSS Versions

As with HTML, CSS has evolved significantly over the years. The following version table gives you an idea of when certain features were added and therefore how stable the support for them are.

| Year | Version | Features |
| ---- | ------- | -------- |
| 1996 | CSS1    | selectors, font, color, background, alignment, margin, border, padding |
| 1998 | CSS2    | positioning, z-index, bidirectional text, shadows |
| 2011 | CSS2.1  | removed incompatible features |
| 1999-2021 | CSS3 | enhancements for media, box, background, borders, color, template, multi-column, selectors |

Beginning with CSS3 the specif

## HTML Versions
- HTML has evolved over the years with different versions introducing new features.
- Notable versions include HTML1, HTML2, HTML3, HTML4, and HTML5.

## Rendering HTML
- HTML files can be saved locally and opened in a browser.
- Use VS Code with the Live Server extension for live preview.
- Online sandboxes like CodePen are useful for experimenting with HTML.

# CSS Selectors

## Introduction

CSS selectors are fundamental for styling HTML elements effectively. They enable us to target specific elements or groups of elements to apply styling rules.

## Types of Selectors

### 1. Element Type Selector

- Targets elements based on their HTML tag name.
- Example:
  ```css
  body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    color: #333;
  }
  ```

### 2. Class Selector

- Targets elements with a specific class attribute.
- Prefixed with a period (.)
- Example:
  ```css
  .highlight {
    background-color: yellow;
  }
  ```

### 3. ID Selector

- Targets a specific element with a unique ID attribute.
- Prefixed with a hash (#).
- Example:
  ```css
  #header {
    font-size: 24px;
  }
  ```

### 4. Descendant Selector

- Selects elements that are descendants of a specified parent element.
- Example:
  ```css
  .container p {
    margin-bottom: 10px;
  }
  ```

### 5. Child Selector

- Selects elements that are direct children of a specified parent element.
- Uses the greater than symbol (>)
- Example:
  ```css
  ul > li {
    list-style-type: none;
  }
  ```

### 6. Attribute Selector

- Selects elements based on their attributes.
- Example:
  ```css
  input[type="text"] {
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
  }
  ```

### 7. Pseudo-class Selector

- Selects elements based on their state or position.
- Example:
  ```css
  a:hover {
    color: red;
  }
  ```

## Conclusion

Understanding CSS selectors is crucial for creating well-structured and maintainable stylesheets. By utilizing various selectors, developers can efficiently apply styles to HTML elements, resulting in visually appealing web pages.


# CSS Declarations

## Introduction

CSS rule declarations specify a property and value to assign when the rule selector matches one or more elements. There are numerous properties defined for modifying the style of an HTML document. Here, we'll discuss some commonly used ones to give you an overview of the wide variety of functionality they represent.

## Units

You can use a variety of units when defining the size of a CSS property. For example, the width of an element can be defined using absolute units such as the number of pixels (px) or inches (in). You can also use relative units such as a percentage of the parent element (50%), a percentage of a minimum viewport dimension (25vmin), or a multiplier of the size of the letter m (1.5rem) as defined by the root element.

```css
p {
  width: 25%;
  height: 30vh;
}
```

Here is a list of the most commonly used units. All of the units are prefixed with a number when used as a property value.

| Unit  | Description                                                         |
|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| px    | The number of pixels                                                |
| pt    | The number of points (1/72 of an inch)                              |
| in    | The number of inches                                                |
| cm    | The number of centimeters                                           |
| %     | A percentage of the parent element                                  |
| em    | A multiplier of the width of the letter m in the parent's font      |
| rem   | A multiplier of the width of the letter m in the root's font        |
| ex    | A multiplier of the height of the element's font                    |
| vw    | A percentage of the viewport's width                                |
| vh    | A percentage of the viewport's height                               |
| vmin  | A percentage of the viewport's smaller dimension                    |
| vmax  | A percentage of the viewport's larger dimension                     |

## Color

CSS defines multiple ways to describe color, ranging from representations familiar to programmers and ones familiar to layout designers and artists.

| Method          | Example                 | Description                                                                                                          |
|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Keyword         | red                     | A set of predefined colors (e.g., white, cornflowerblue, darkslateblue)                                              |
| RGB hex         | #00FFAA22 or #0FA2      | Red, green, and blue as a hexadecimal number, with an optional alpha opacity                                          |
| RGB function    | rgb(128, 255, 128, 0.5)| Red, green, and blue as a percentage or number between 0 and 255, with an optional alpha opacity percentage          |
| HSL             | hsl(180, 30%, 90%, 0.5) | Hue, saturation, and light, with an optional opacity percentage. Hue is the position on the 365-degree color wheel |

# CSS Fonts

## Introduction

Choosing appropriate fonts is crucial for web design, as it significantly impacts user experience. The CSS `font-family` property allows you to specify font preferences, ensuring compatibility across different platforms.

## Font Families

There are four main font families:
- **Serif**: Fonts with small strokes at the end of characters.
- **Sans-serif**: Fonts without these strokes.
- **Fixed**: Fonts with consistent character sizes, ideal for code or tabular data.
- **Symbol**: Fonts for non-language characters like emojis.

## Importing Fonts

You can define custom fonts using `@font-face`, specifying font names and sources:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Quicksand';
  src: url('https://cs260.click/fonts/quicksand.ttf');
}

p {
  font-family: Quicksand;
}

@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Rubik+Microbe&display=swap');

p {
  font-family: 'Rubik Microbe';
}
```
# CSS Animation

CSS animations bring interactivity and dynamism to web applications. They are created using animation properties and keyframes to define the element's appearance at different stages of the animation. Let's outline the process with an example:

1. **Initial Setup**:
    css
    p {
      text-align: center;
      font-size: 20vh;
    }
    

2. **Animation Properties**:
    css
    p {
      text-align: center;
      font-size: 20vh;
      animation-name: demo;
      animation-duration: 3s;
    }
    

3. **Defining Keyframes**:
    css
    @keyframes demo {
      from {
        font-size: 0vh;
      }
      95% {
        font-size: 21vh;
      }
      to {
        font-size: 20vh;
      }
    }
    

4. **Final Result**:
    - The paragraph text zooms in until it's 20% of the view height.
    - At 95% of the animation, it bounces slightly larger than the final size.

# Responsive Design

Responsive design is crucial for modern web applications to ensure optimal display across various devices and screen sizes.

## Display Property

- CSS `display` property controls how HTML elements are rendered.
- Values include:
  - `none`: Element is hidden.
  - `block`: Element takes full width.
  - `inline`: Element's width adjusts to content.
  - `flex`: Children are displayed flexibly.
  - `grid`: Children are displayed in a grid layout.

## Viewport Meta Tag

- Include `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />` to prevent automatic scaling on mobile browsers.

## Float

- `float` property moves an element left or right of its container, allowing inline elements to wrap around it.

## Media Queries

- `@media` queries apply CSS rules based on device size and orientation.
- Example: `@media (orientation: portrait) { ... }`

## Grid and Flexbox

- CSS Grid and Flexbox automatically adjust child elements based on screen size, aiding responsive layout design.

# CSS Grid

CSS Grid layout is a powerful tool for creating responsive grid-based designs. It allows for easy arrangement of child elements in a grid format.

## Basic Grid Setup

- Start with a container element containing child elements.
- Apply grid layout to the container using `display: grid;`.
- Define the layout of grid columns with `grid-template-columns`.
- Set the height of grid rows with `grid-auto-rows`.
- Add a gap between grid items using `grid-gap`.

Example:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  grid-auto-rows: 300px;
  grid-gap: 1em;
}
```

# CS 260 - Web Programming

## CSS Frameworks

CSS frameworks provide commonly used functions and components in web applications, enhancing development efficiency and user experience.

### Tailwind

- Tailwind CSS offers a unique approach, applying small, specific styles directly to HTML elements.
- Components like images and text are styled using Tailwind classes directly in HTML.

### Bootstrap

- It offers a comprehensive set of components and styles for creating responsive web applications.
- Bootstrap components can be easily integrated into projects by linking to Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript files via CDN.
- Usage example: Bootstrap buttons provide pre-styled, visually appealing buttons with a single CSS class.

html
```
<!-- Bootstrap button example -->
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Bootstrap</button>
```
# JavaScript for Web Development

## Introduction

JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for web development. It enables interactive and dynamic content on web pages, making them more engaging for users.

## Basic Concepts

- **Variables**: Used to store data values. Variables can be declared using `var`, `let`, or `const`.
- **Data Types**: JavaScript supports various data types such as numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, and objects.
- **Functions**: Blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. Functions can be declared and invoked as needed.
- **Conditional Statements**: Used for decision-making in code execution. Common constructs include `if`, `else`, and `switch` statements.
- **Loops**: Used to repeat code execution until a condition is met. Common loop types include `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.

## DOM Manipulation

- **DOM (Document Object Model)**: Represents the structure of an HTML document as a tree-like structure, allowing JavaScript to interact with and manipulate HTML elements.
- **Selectors**: Used to target specific HTML elements within the DOM using methods like `getElementById`, `getElementsByClassName`, `querySelector`, and `querySelectorAll`.
- **Event Handling**: Enables the execution of JavaScript code in response to user actions (e.g., clicks, keypresses, mouse movements). Event listeners are used to listen for and respond to events.

## Advanced Topics

- **Asynchronous JavaScript**: Allows code execution to continue while waiting for certain operations to complete, such as fetching data from an external server or executing a timer-based action. Promises and async/await are common patterns for handling asynchronous operations.
- **ES6 Features**: ECMAScript 6 (ES6) introduced several new features and syntax enhancements to JavaScript, including arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, and classes.
- **Modules**: Enables modular JavaScript development by allowing code to be organized into separate files and imported/exported as needed.
- **AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)**: Allows web pages to make asynchronous HTTP requests to a server without reloading the entire page. Commonly used for fetching data from APIs and updating page content dynamically.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Development Tools**: Includes browsers' built-in developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools) for debugging and inspecting JavaScript code, as well as code editors like Visual Studio Code.
- **Libraries and Frameworks**: Popular JavaScript libraries and frameworks such as jQuery, React, Angular, and Vue.js provide pre-built solutions for common web development tasks, enhancing productivity and scalability.

## Conclusion

JavaScript is a powerful language essential for modern web development. By mastering its fundamentals and exploring advanced topics, developers can create interactive, responsive, and feature-rich web applications.
