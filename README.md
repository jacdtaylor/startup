## Startup Specification

### Elevator Pitch

Have you ever been frustrated with a group project? Have you ever been overwhelmed with your class schedule? Do you have a seemingly endless list of things that you need to do? This task manager application allows you to keep track of that list of 'to-dos.' Organize your own personal responsibilities or work as a team in a shared workspace.
